## üìù Getting Started

[Head over to the documentation to get started.](https://flowctl.app/getting-started/requirements/)

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **What is this?**<br/>
A fan controller with open-source hardware, software and a CLI.

- **Who's it for?**<br/>
It's primarily aimed at desktop computer users, but it can fit many use cases.

- **How can I use flowcontrol?**<br/>
At the moment, you will need the ability to solder so you can build the hardware, if it proves popular I may release some pre-built controllers. [You can find the documentation on building the controller here.](https://flowctl.app/getting-started/requirements/)

- **Why would I use this over X?**<br/>
This started out as a project for me to use personally, I was tired of expensive fan controllers with proprietary connectors and no Linux support.
