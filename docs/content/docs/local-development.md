# Local Development

The code base consists:

  - [flowcontrol](#desktop-application)
  - [flowcontrol-monitor](#desktop-application)
  - [flowcontrol-cli](#cli)
  - [firmware](#firmware)
  - [documentation](#documentation)

`flowcontrol` and `flowcontrol-cli` are currently independent, I'm looking to consolidate their codebase now they're both using Go and utilise shared packages for stuff like serial communication.
