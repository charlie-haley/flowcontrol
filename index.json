It\u0026rsquo;s built using wails\nflowcontrol-monitor This is the supplementary application to the main one. It provides system metrics such as GPU Clock and temperatures using LibreHardwareMonitorLib. I\u0026rsquo;m aiming to make this an optional component for people who want hardware metrics beyond the scope of the controller, it\u0026rsquo;s currently bundled with the release.\nflowcontrol-cli A CLI application built using cobra\n"},{"uri":"http://flowctl.app/pcb/schematic/","title":"Schematic","tags":[],"description":"","content":"If you can solder SMD, there\u0026rsquo;s a PCB with gerber files available.
